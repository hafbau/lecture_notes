## Client side JS and Intro to jQuery

Hey crew, thanks for the class today. We started by talking about Client side versus server side javascript. We then moved to talking about the DOM. We demoed manipulating and played with DOM events.

In the secoond half, we talked through events handling and DOM manipulation again but in the context of jQuery.

Please find notes and code we wrote here: [Code and notes](https://github.com/hafbau/lecture_notes/tree/master/w4d2)

Thanks till next time 🤘🏿!
