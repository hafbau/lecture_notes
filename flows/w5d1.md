# W05D01 - SQL Intro

### To Do
- [x] Introduction to RDBMS
- [x] The Relational Data Model (Tables, Columns, Rows)
- [x] `SELECT` Statements
- [x] Filtering and ordering
- [x] Joining tables
- [x] Grouping records
- [x] Aggregation functions
- [x] `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`

### Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
- A program that serves, **and** controls interactions with, one or more _Relational Databases_
- Communicates using a custom protocol (eg. `postgres://` for postgres) that sits on top of TCP
- Front End <-----`http` + `tcp`-----> Back End <-----`postgres` + `tcp`-----> RDBMS

### Structured Data
- The **S** in **SQL** is for _structured_. This means that our data must conform to a _structure_ in order to store it in the database.
- The data itself is stored in **tables** which define things such as field names, data types, and other data constraints
- You are probably familiar with tables already if you've used programs like Excel or Calc
- Tables are made up of **columns** and **rows**
  - Columns are called `fields`
  - Rows are called `records`
- Each table describes an entity (eg. `users`, `products`, `shifts`, `tweets`)
  - The fields represent properties of the entity
  - Each record represents one unique entity

### Primary Keys
- In order to reference a particular record in a table, each one is given a unique identifier we call a **Primary Key**
- Other tables can then make reference to a particular record in another table by storing the Primary Keys value
- We call a Primary Key stored in another table a **Foreign Key**
- It is through this Primary Key/Foreign Key relationship that our tables are _related_ to one another

### SELECT Challenges

For the first 5 queries, we'll be using the `users` table.

![users table](https://andydlindsay-portfolio.s3.amazonaws.com/lighthouse/w5d1-users.io.png)

1. List total number of users

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM users;
```

2. List users over the age of 18

```sql
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE age > 18;
```

3. List users who are over the age of 18 and have the last name 'Barrows'

```sql
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE age > 18 AND last_name = 'Barrows';
```

4. List users over the age of 18 who live in Canada sorted by age from oldest to youngest and then last name alphabetically

```sql
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE age > 18 AND country = 'Canada'
ORDER BY age DESC, last_name;
```

5. List users who live in Canada and whose accounts are overdue

```sql
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE country = 'Canada' AND payment_due_date < '2020-09-14';

-- using the NOW() function to get the current date/time
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE country = 'Canada' AND payment_due_date < NOW();
```

6. List all the countries users live in; don't repeat any countries

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT country
FROM users
ORDER BY country;
```

**(RESUME RECORDING)**

For the rest of the queries, we'll be using the `albums` and `songs` tables.

![albums and songs](https://andydlindsay-portfolio.s3.amazonaws.com/lighthouse/albums-and-songs.png)

7. List all albums along with their songs

```sql
SELECT *
FROM albums
JOIN songs ON albums.id = album_id;
```

8. List all albums along with how many songs each album has

```sql
SELECT album_name, COUNT(songs.id)
FROM albums
JOIN songs ON albums.id = album_id
GROUP BY album_name;
```

9. Enhance previous query to only include albums that have more than 10 songs

```sql
SELECT album_name, COUNT(songs.id) AS num_songs
FROM albums
JOIN songs ON albums.id = album_id
GROUP BY album_name
HAVING COUNT(songs.id) > 10;
```

10. List ALL albums in the database, along with their songs if any

```sql
SELECT *
FROM albums
LEFT JOIN songs ON albums.id = album_id;

-- using RIGHT join
SELECT *
FROM songs
RIGHT JOIN albums ON albums.id = album_id;
```

11. List albums along with average song rating

```sql
SELECT album_name, AVG(songs.rating) AS avg_rating
FROM albums
INNER JOIN songs ON albums.id = songs.album_id
GROUP BY album_name;

SELECT album_name, ROUND(AVG(songs.rating) * 100) / 100 AS avg_rating
FROM albums
INNER JOIN songs ON albums.id = songs.album_id
GROUP BY album_name;
```

12. List albums and songs with rating higher than album average

```sql
SELECT album_name,
  song_name,
  rating,
  (SELECT AVG(songs.rating) FROM songs WHERE album_id = albums.id) AS album_avg
FROM albums
JOIN songs ON albums.id = songs.album_id
WHERE rating > (SELECT AVG(songs.rating) FROM songs WHERE album_id = albums.id);
```

### LIMIT and OFFSET

```sql
SELECT *
FROM users
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20;
```
