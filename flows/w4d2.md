### Intro to frontend JS [15m]

For the last week you were working on an app called TinyApp. It was an app that would store urls and shorten them for people to reuse. The biggest that was missing in it was the asthetic and feel. The app felt a tad bit 1999-2002 .

This week, we're building an SPA - which means no routes, no ejs! It means writing JS on the frontend, JS that only runs on the browser.

Introducing Javascript ( on the front end )
From the start until now you have been using something called node, which is a javascript engine which runs on the backend. You were able to make a server that serves up HTML files.

Just like your machine that has node, a javascript engine ( not always the same one ), your browser has on as well. Infact all browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc) has a built in javascript engine to interpret js that is embedded in a HTML page.

On the server, our node had access to something called process.argv and other process functions. It does not make sense to have this on the front-end due to the fact that the scripts that will be ran on will not need access or need the access to the file paths, argumets, and what not. We do have access to new things like document and other intersting things. Generally speaking, when writting Javascript on the front end, the context changes, which gives you access to alot of different global variables that you did not have access when writting it on the backend.

Cool Functions on the Frontend
window

window.open()

window.history.back()

navigator.getBattery().then((b) => console.log(b));

navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(res => console.log(res))

Context matters.

process (and all methods e.g process.argv), setTimeout, require, window, fs, console, navigator,
document, module, exports, npm, location

| Backend (NodeJS) | Frontend (Browser) | Both |

### What is the DOM [15m]

- Meet Dominic; a married busy mom of two, trying to stay sane. She meets the Browser Yoda, and the browser said the answer is DOM!
- It's the way the browser organizes our HTML / CSS for easy access by code (JS).
- HTML DOM is a tree datastructure whose nodes are HTML elements, their contents and their attributes
- Visualization helps:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to my page!</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p>My Favourite Numbers</p>
      <ul id="main-list">
        <li>One</li>
        <li>Two</li>
        <li>Three</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Let's manipulate the DOM [10m]

#### Create / Select / Insert
- Explain starter code

- Next:
```js
const contentNode = document.getElementsByClassName('content')[0]
contentNode.before(introEl)

// Don't worry about how I know these methods - documentation on MDN / SO
introEl.insertAdjacentHTML('beforebegin', '<img src="https://www.gstatic.com/tv/thumb/persons/64293/64293_v9_ba.jpg" alt="Vanilla Ice" />')

// Questions??
```

### DOM Events [15m]

- A mother knows. The browser is truly a mother.
- Just like mother nature sends us all this signals - climate change / global warming,
  + And we (our government) only listen to a few? Realistically so.
  + We (using JS) can listen to events from the browser.

- DevTool example monitoring all events (monitorEvents / unmonitorEvents)
- DevTool example listening to 'mousemove'

```js
// Events
const buttonEl = document.createElement('button')
buttonEl.innerText = 'Farts'

const fartFn = function(event) {
  console.log('Fartsssss')
  const span = document.createElement('span').innerText = 'fart!'
  event.target.after(span)
}
buttonEl.addEventListener('click', fartFn)
```
