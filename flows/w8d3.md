### Unit Testing Vs. End to End Testing
Unit Testing: Testing one component or function in isolation. A "Unit". Want to keep the amount of code we are testing small.

Integration Testing: Testing the Integration of more than one unit together. How data is passed and received. Timing.

End to End Testing: Start to finish testing. Mimicking a real user interacting with the application. Behavior driven. You care about what appears on the screen (or the results of the program) instead of what code is running.
