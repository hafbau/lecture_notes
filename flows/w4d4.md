Response Web Design

# NOTES TO SELF BEFORE LECTURE
- ADD AN IMAGE FOR FLEX EXERCISE TO THE GIST

## Responsive Web Design

- Intro with wikipedia definition
- DevTool devices button
- Craiglist -> Not responsive
  + They use a mobile site instead. Like fb does too
- LHL Compass -> responsive.
  + It shrinks (content area)
  + It shape shifts (menu shifting)

**That is our goal for today**

## Demo
- Context for demo
- Start a HTML template
  + index.html
    - skeleton
    - comment out viewport meta
    - some
      + header+(main>p)+footer
    - Responsive by default
  + replace the <p> with three divs

- Lets write some CSS
  + Link CSS
  + box-sizing for *
  + reset margins

  + header {
    height: 50px;
    background-color
  }

  + footer {
    height: 30px;
    bgcl
  }

  + main { border: 2px }

  + main div {
    height, width: 150px; margin: 10px; lheight: 1;
    text-align: center, bgclr, display: inlblck
  }

  Test responsiveness; the boxes cut-off.
  - we should use relative unit

### Relative sizes

  + Ems / Rems
    - ems are relative to font-size of parent
    - change width to 5em
    - modify font-size of `main` to 36px
    - why font-size?
      + because news paper layout designers
    
    - Cons of em:
      + someone changes the font size and not expecting layout consequence

  + REMs
    - html { font-size }

  
  - using percentages %
  - so % of what?
    + % of the parent
      - change 'main' size to show

    - shrink / expand indefinitely
    - with max-width
    - with min-width
      + usual min-width around 300px

    - still looks awful
      + there's a reason for that - uncomment viewport meta

  + Responsiveness is not just about Elasticity; could include shapeshifting as well
    - would it be cool if we conditionally display part of the UI
    - MEDIA QUERY
      + Selective display
      + Intentional scaling / shrinking
      + Google 'media queries mdn'
      + talk through syntax and options

    - One major part of the syntax is breakpoints
      + It is the value of the condition to be checked
      + google common breakpoints
        - this is basically BS why?
      + your breakpoint should be driven by your content

    - media query for header
      ```css
      @media screen and (max-width: 500px) {
        header {
          bckgcl:
        }
      }
      ```

    - another example with min-width
    ```css
    @media screen and (min-width: 700px) {
      footer {
        bckgcl:
      }
    }
    ```

### Flexbox v 2

Classwork [15 + 5 + 5m]

[Image list here](https://gist.github.com/hafbau/fdcbfd45afdfb7e3f030931dbf3db585)

- create a Tiger King ImageGridList
- make it responsive (reduce the picture shown at 500px)



#### Flex children recap [5m]

  - order
  - flex-grow
  - flex-basis


### SASS [30m]

*Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets*

- go to sass website
- is a CSS preprocessor (google css preprocessor mdn)
- needs compilation
  + for this I'm using a sass library
  + there's node-sass which you'll be using most times
    - I'm not cos to show alternative approach (it sucks)
    - also, I'm lazy to set up a server, which is required to use node-sass
- there are two flavours for writing Sass. `.sass` and `.scss`
  + I'm using scss; its a superset of css - basically, you can write css directly in your scss file as well

**GOAL**

- explore the features of sass by rewriting Scss and inspecting the compiled css


**Start**

- create a sassy-styles.css file
- update the link tag; note it's NOT .scss, it is the compiled version `.css`

- copy over previously written css; e.g. flex.css
- compile, using the command line
- Test by inspecting the created sassy-styles.css AND the browser

- It works!

- Talk about the map files
  + helps Chrome figure out mapping and helps us for debugging

### Variables

- By convention, put them on the top of the file
- syntax `$varname: value`
  e.g `$base-font: Arial`; use in html {}

**Example 2**

```css
$border-width: 
$border-color:
$$border-style:
```

- use in main {}
- recompile and inspect compiled
  + switch on --watch

- Can a variable point to other variables? YES
 `$border: $border-width $border-color ..`

Questions about variables??

> Note:
> JS can access CSS variables but not sass variables

### Nesting / Namespacing Styles

e.g main div {} compiled from main { div { } }

**What about  `&` ?**

  - do an example with main { div { &:hover { } } }
  - think of it like `this`

### @extend

- lets us reuse a set of css rules

```css
.text-center {
  text-align: center;
}

.header {
  @extend .text-center;
}
```

### @mixin

- they are like functions!
  + they could even take args

**Without Args**

```css
@mixin header-styles {
  fs: 12px;
  text-dec: strikethrough
}

.my-header {
  @include header-styles();
}
```

**With Args**

```css
@mixin with-args ($params) {
  fs: 12px * $params;
  text-dec: strikethrough
}

.my-header {
  @include header-styles(2);
}
```

### Modularization

- breakup files to not have large files; or
- say we want to make variables available to other files
- factor variables out to a _variable.scss
- talk to the naming convention === partials
  + consequence is corresponding css file is not generated

- @import 'variables.scss'
  + does not need the underscoore
